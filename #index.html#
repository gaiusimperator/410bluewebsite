                                The output was unimpressive, confusing and not easy to read. Also, notice the banana pudding wasn’t tagged correctly. This program simply takes a dictionary file and assigns part of speech from a database (I’m assuming). Our program could have a much better UI and better rules. Also, it would allow the end user to change the assignment if incorrect.

                                This site has a similar idea to ESL Colors. It uses colors to help differentiate parts of speech as well as preceding tags. However, we have the same issue again with manipulation/correction, and banana pudding. This is also hard to read and the user has to constantly refer back to the legend to see what part of speech the word is. It is great in that it accounts for an impressive number of parts of speech, but it may be overboard. Suggest perhaps being able to scale with level of instruction.

                        Constant between all of these is that there is no nuance, it’s simply pulling word assignment without any context. Also, none of them allow the end user to make any changes to the designations and the UIs are horribad. There are various games out there but are very low level and not really what we’re looking at.
